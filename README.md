UPDATE October 1, 2021

*Updated Installer v3

Thanks to working with Supreme team we have made a one line installer .
*Edit V3 is 90% Supremes work. 

V3 is a MAJOR UPDATE . 

-no more scripts it directly launches exes from retropie.

-qjoypad auto loads layout with same name as exe.

Open terminal type 

curl -sSL https://git.io/Jz9O3 | bash
 

It will install everything for you including the default mugen .

*How to add mugens?

-open pixel desktop

-move mugens to home/pi/retropie/roms/wine/games  

-optimize your data/mugen.cfg if necessary .

-rename your exe to mugen.exe .
 
 Remeber this is a low end "pc".

Make sure to change all the mugens you add controls in and mugen.cfg file or in game.


*Why didn't this work on my/pre-made retropie?

-If using Supreme use thier installer not this one . 

-A very uncommon external Hdd issue has been seen. Where wine and box86 don't work with a hdd plugged in. We have not experienced this on the 6 builds we tested on. Only been reported one time.
