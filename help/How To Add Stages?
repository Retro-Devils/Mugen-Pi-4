How To Add Stages from: https://www.wikihow.com/Add-Mugen-Characters

______# Step 1 #______
Download the stage files. Stages can usually be downloaded from the same places that you find character files. 
Like the character files, stages typically come in ZIP or RAR format.

______# Step 2 #______
Open the downloaded file to see the stage files. Double-click the ZIP file or open the RAR file to see the contents. 
Stages come with a DEF and an SFF file. There may also be an MP3 file if a soundtrack is included.

______# Step 3 #______
Move the DEF and SFF files into the .stages folder. You'll find this folder in your mugen folder.
Move the MP3 file into the sound folder if the stage came with one.

______# Step 4 #______
Reopen the "select.def" file if you closed it. 
You'll be adding the stage to your Stage Select screen, as well as assigning it to characters for Arcade Mode.
The "select.def" file is located in the data folder.

______# Step 5 #______
Find the .[ExtraStages] section. This is where all of your downloaded stages are added.


______# Step 6 #______
Enter in the path to your new stage. Start a new line beneath the existing stages and type stages/stageName.def.

______# Step 7 #______

Assign a stage to a character for Arcade Mode. 
If you want a certain character to always appear on a certain stage when encountered in Arcade Mode, you can add it to their character entry in the [Characters] section.
Add a comma to the end of the character entry plus the path to the stage name. 
For example, to set LINK_3D to always appear on the Castle.def stage, you would type LINK_3D, stages/Castle.def.
Add the order of the character at the end of the entry. For example, LINK_3D, stages/Castle.def, order=3
