Mugen = awesome.  It allows you to take fighters across any and all 2D fighters (excluding SF4 of course) and put them in dream matches.  
You could have Street Fighter 2 Ryu fighting Street Fighter 3 Ryu.  Different Terry's fighting each other.  The list is endless.   
There are also custom characters for the game such as Peter Griffin, Homer Simpson, Mario, Duck Dodgers, and many many more.

What is Mugen?
M.U.G.E.N (Wikipedia) is a free software or game engine that allows any person to create his own 2D fighting game. 
It was developed by Elecbyte and first released in 1999 for free. 
You can create or download Mugen characters made by others from popular games like Sonic and Mario, chars from animes like Naruto and DBZ and much more. 
Winmugen allows that you not only create characters but everything about a fighting game such as Stage, Screenpack etc. 
This engine lets you fight chars that you normally wouldn't like Goku vs Naruto ( Dragon Dall vs Naruto) or Ryu vs Scorpion ( Mortal Kombat vs Street Fighter ) etc.
